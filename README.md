## Deprecated!!##

This add-on has been deprecated. The Channel Value Retention Service (https://github.com/NIVeriStandAdd-Ons/Channel-Value-Retention-Service) is recommended for new systems.

## User Channel Value Retention Custom Workspace Object ##

The are scenarios in which it can be necessary to retain system values across an un-deploy and re-deploy of the System Definition file. For example, lets say you're using a user channel to count the test cycles of an ECU and you're incrementing this value. Sometime through your test, you realize you need to un-deploy the system to change an alarm value. So, you un-deploy, make your changes, and redeploy. But your user channels (and all others for that matter) will return to their default values and we're running a long-term test so we want to continue counting cycles from where we left off. This workspace tool allows your User Channels to be re-deployed with the value they had when the system was un-deployed (assuming the workspace was open). The workspace object monitors user selected User Channels and sets their default values in the host side copy of the System Definition file so when the system is redeployed it uses these new values.   

### LabVIEW Version ###

[10/19/2015 VincentRuault]
- Source code migrated to LV-2014.
- Changed internal code:
	** Default values for User-channel not saved at each change. Default values saved at the end (when receiving "Stop" event).
	** changed timeout value from 10 ms to 100 ms to minimize CPU usage because of this tool.
- Limited testing :
	** Test with engine running on Windows. Only 2 scenarios validated (empty Sysdef file with only 05 User-channels): first is from NIVS getting started window, use Run options. Second is when we deploy and undeploy from System-Explorer Windows.
	** Test with engine running on cRIO PharLap. Only 2 scenarios validated (empty Sysdef file with only 05 User-channels): first is from NIVS getting started window, use Run options. Second is when we deploy and undeploy from System-Explorer Windows.

[First Version]
This Add-On was developed using LabVIEW 2012

### Built Availability ###

There are no available builds of this IP.

### Quality, Limitations ###

This IP has two known issues:

1. The workspace object must be running in order to properly track your User Channels. Unfortunately, only the first screen of the Workspace is started when the workspace is first opened. So, this Workspace Object either needs to be placed on your first Workspace screen or you need to ensure that you go to the screen that contains this object every time you deploy your System Definition file, to start that screen and thereby this object. This is a limitation of VeriStand, not this add-on.

2. Based on how the channels are being queried, the System Definition file must be deployed before you can configure the workspace object. The workspace object source could be modified to poll the channels when the system is offline or undeployed.
